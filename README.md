# Real-World Projects

### Let's increase the skills level of the newcoming Developer, by directly involving the Tech Community itself!

Our purpose is to create a collection of useful real-world projects to **really** learn Programming with a learn-by-doing approach.

If you are in the tech industry, you can contribute by sharing an idea from your own experience, repurposing it for a learning context.

People would use it to learn new technologies, environments, best practices, and so on.

There aren't any limitation to the ideas, they could be web projects, mobile, software, gaming, IoT and so on.

# Important

Since TomorrowDevs is a Mentorship program oriented to help people to achieve their goals in the tech industry, we could use all of the submitted projects for our Learning Paths, by dispatching them in the right order and needs for each specific person.

# Contributing

Here are the contribution guidelines for this project.
