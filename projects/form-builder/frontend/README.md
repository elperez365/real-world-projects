# Form Builder - FRONTEND SIDE

The front-end is a single page application showing the list of forms (Use the title provided by the APIs).  
Clicking on a form should show the form and allow the user to submit a new entry, applying the validations specified in the back-office.  
The form should be validated on the front-end, and the errors should be shown to the user.  
The form should be submitted via AJAX, and the response should be shown to the user.  

# Requirements

1. A front-end framework of choice (VueJS, React, Angular, etc., or even plain JS)
2. Nothing should be hardcoded (Ex. the API endpoints should be in a config file, not in the code)
