# Form Builder - DATABASE SIDE

In the `schema.sql`Â file you can find the database schema suggested as a starting point for the project.  
I strongly suggest to use it as an example, yet you should create your own schema so that you can take your own approach to the project.

# Requirements

1. MySQL / MariaDB should be available on the system (you can use Docker to simplify the setup)
2. Nothing, really. Rock on!
